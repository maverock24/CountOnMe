# CountOnMe

CountOnMe is a mobile application built with React Native and Expo. It features a counter and timer functionality, allowing users to count repetitions and manage workout intervals. The app also includes an AI-powered workout analyzer using Netlify Functions and Google Gemini.

## Features

- **Counter**: Increment and decrement a counter with a reset option.
- **Timer**: Set multiple timers with different intervals and track the progress.
- **AI Workout Analyzer**: Get AI-generated workout plans and calorie estimates.
- **Themed UI**: Supports light and dark themes.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both mobile and web platforms.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://gitlab.com/yourusername/CountOnMe.git
   cd CountOnMe
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**

   - Create a `.env` file in the project root with your Google API key:
     ```env
     GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key_here
     ```

4. **Build the static web export:**

   ```sh
   npx expo export:web
   ```

   This will generate the static site in the `dist/` directory.

5. **Install Netlify CLI (recommended as a dev dependency):**

   ```sh
   npm install --save-dev netlify-cli
   ```

6. **Run the app locally with Netlify Dev:**

   ```sh
   npx netlify dev
   ```

   - The app will be available at [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888)
   - Netlify Dev will serve the static site from `dist/` and proxy API requests to Netlify Functions in `netlify/functions/`.

## Usage

- **Counter Tab**: Use the slider to set the initial count value. Use the buttons to increment or decrement the count. The reset button resets the count to the initial value.
- **Timer Tab**: Select a timer interval and start the timer. The timer will automatically switch to the next interval when the current one ends.
- **AI Workout Analyzer**: Enter your weight, exercise, training level, or calories to get an AI-generated workout plan.

## Project Structure

- `app`: Contains the main application components and screens.
- `components`: Reusable components used across the application.
- `constants`: Contains constant values used in the application.
- `assets`: Contains fonts and images used in the application.
- `netlify/functions`: Contains Netlify serverless functions (e.g., `analyze.js`).
- `dist`: Static web export output (generated by Expo export).

## Scripts

- `npm start`: Start the Expo development server.
- `npm run android`: Start the application on an Android emulator.
- `npm run ios`: Start the application on an iOS simulator.
- `npm run web`: Start the application in a web browser.
- `npm test`: Run the test suite.
- `npx expo export:web`: Build the static web export for Netlify.
- `npx netlify dev`: Run the local Netlify server for static site + functions.

## Troubleshooting

- If you change or rename Netlify function files, stop and restart `npx netlify dev`.
- If you see 404s for functions, ensure the function file exists in `netlify/functions/` and matches the endpoint (e.g., `analyze.js` â†’ `/.netlify/functions/analyze`).
- If you see stale content, delete the `.netlify/` and `dist/` folders, rebuild, and restart Netlify Dev.
- Make sure your `.env` file is present and contains a valid `GOOGLE_API_KEY`.
